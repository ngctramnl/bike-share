# Bike-share program analysis
## About
* This analysis is for case study 1 from the Google Data Analytics Certificate (Cyclistic). It’s originally based on the case study "'Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished’: Divvy and Data Visualization" written by Kevin Hartman (found here: https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study).
## Business tasks
*  Understand how casual riders and annual members use bikes differently
## Dataset
* We will be using the historical trip data in 2019 and 2020 from the [Divvy dataset](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) for the case study. Divvy is Chicago-based bike-share program that features nearly 6,000 bicycles and more than 600 docking stations.
## Documentation of cleaning or manipulation of data
* Downloaded Divvy data were consolidated into a single dataframe. Code and report of the analysis can be found [here](https://ngctramnl.github.io/bike-share/)
## Conclusions
* Casual riders tend to use bikes longer than members. 
* Casual riders spend more time using Cylistic bikes than members across the week. 
* Members use bikes proportionally across the week, while casual riders particularly stay longer on Thursday and Friday. This could be because they want to maximise the money they’ve spent on their ride.
